# Pathway Illumination — Site Build

This repository contains a static site build generated using Lovable for the **Pathway Illumination** project.

---

## Purpose

This repo serves as:

- A snapshot of the current Pathway Illumination site build
- A reference artifact for layout, structure, and design decisions
- A clean handoff point for future platform integration (e.g., WordPress)

This repository is **not** intended to be the primary place for ongoing content editing.

---

## How This Was Created

- Site designed and structured using Lovable
- Exported via GitHub integration
- Sync disconnected to preserve a stable snapshot
- Files represent a complete, valid web project (HTML, assets, configuration)

---

## What This Repo Is (and Is Not)

**This repo is:**
- A build artifact
- A visual and structural reference
- A stable checkpoint in the project’s evolution

**This repo is not:**
- The primary writing or blogging environment
- The long-term CMS
- Actively edited on a day-to-day basis

---

## Status

**Archived build** — subject to future refreshes from Lovable as needed.

Future updates may replace this snapshot if the site is redesigned or re-exported.

---

## Notes for Future Me (or Collaborators)

- Entry point: `index.html`
- Core structure lives in `/src`
- Static assets live in `/public`
- Configuration files reflect the build environment and can be ignored unless rebuilding locally

This repo exists to reduce friction later, not to add it.
